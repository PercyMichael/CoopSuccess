                question: "What is Cooperative Crowdfunding?",
                answer:
                  "Cooperative Crowdfunding is a revolutionary way to raise funds, where contributions are shared among multiple causes. It creates a supportive community, making fundraising more accessible and helping more people than traditional crowdfunding ever could.",

                  "How is Crowdfunding 2.0 different from traditional crowdfunding?",
                answer:
                  "Cooperative Crowdfunding is built on a revolutionary cooperative model where participants both give and receive financial benefits. Unlike traditional crowdfunding, which focuses on one-time donations for individual projects, Cooperative Crowdfunding splits contributions across multiple causes, creating a supportive network. This approach makes fundraising more accessible, helps more people succeed, and fosters a collaborative community.",

                answer:
                  "Cooperative Universal Income Replacement (CUIR) is a revolutionary system designed to replace traditional income sources in a rapidly changing world. As AI, robotics, and advanced technology continue to eliminate jobs faster than new ones can be created, CUIR provides a much-needed solution by offering a sustainable income and daily cash flow. It empowers members to achieve financial stability and independence, ensuring they can thrive in the 21st century despite technological disruptions.",

                question: "What does “Turning Giving Into Receiving” mean?",
                answer:
                  "This phrase represents CoopC’s core philosophy, where your initial financial contribution not only supports others but also sets you up with your own Cooperative Crowdfunding system. This system empowers you to raise the funds you need to cover monthly expenses, support meaningful causes, and fund the life you’ve always dreamed of. By giving, you create a ripple effect of shared success, leading to personal financial benefits, community growth, and a sustainable income. Turning your giving into receiving!",
